# sc-compReg_matlab
 The comparison of gene regulatory networks between disease versus healthy or between two different treatments is an important scientific problem. We propose sc-compReg as a method for the single cell comparative regulatory analysis based on single cell gene expression (scRNA-seq) and single cell chromatin accessibility data (scATAC-seq) from two different conditions. Our software sc-compReg can be used as a stand-alone package that provides joint clustering and embedding of the cells from both scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq, and construction of differential regulatory networks across two conditions.
## Run sc-compReg:

Run sc-compReg by following two steps:

### Step 1: get cell label (here we recomend CoupledNMF method)

script

### Step 2: comparative Regulatory analysis
